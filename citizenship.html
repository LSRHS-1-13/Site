    <p><span style= "color:silver">Citizenship</span> is an important part of every day life, because the citizens make up the country and thus are the most important part of a country.<br>
       <span style= "color:silver">Honesty</span> is an important part of being a citizen because lying leads to corruption which is a plague to nations. <br>
       <span style= "color:silver">Compassion</span> is a neccesary part of being a good citizen because a country prospers when everyone helps eachother out in whatever way they can. <br>
       Having <span style= "color:silver">Respect</span> for your peers allows you to learn from their sucesses and failiures and creates a more productive society. <br>
       Taking <span style= "color:silver">Responsibility</span> for your duties creates less crime if everyone knows what they have to do and what will happen if they don't. <br>
       Having <span style= "color:silver">Courage</span> allows citizens to stand up for themselves and their communities and is a vital part of being a citizen.<br>
       Another important trait of any citizen should be their <span style= "color:silver">Willingness To Serve</span> their society and country in any way possible in order to improve the world.<br>
       One impressive act of citizenship is the stories of people <span style= "color:silver">Risking Their Lives</span> to save others from the destructive power of hurricane Irma.</p>
