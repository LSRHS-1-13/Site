    <h1> Image Formats</h1>
    <p> GIF's are useful as a result of their low file size, but have multiple downsides including a limitation to the amount of colors that can be used as well as not being able to show gradients well.</p>
    <p> JPG's have the best quality and are the best for gradients and shadows, but lower quality can severly impact the picture.</p>
    <p> PNG's again have a very limited number of colors to use, as well as having very large file sizes and not being supported by some major web browsers.</p>
